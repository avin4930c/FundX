## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   MetaMask browser extension

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fundx
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Install web3 (smart contract) dependencies
cd web3
npm install

# Install webclient dependencies
cd ../webclient
npm install
```

## Running the Project

### 1. Start Local Blockchain

```bash
cd web3
npx hardhat node
```

Keep this terminal running. Note down the private keys for testing.

### 2. Deploy Smart Contract

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd web3
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network local
```

Note down the deployed contract address.

### 3. Add Validators

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/add-validators.js --network local
```

### 4. Start Web Client

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd webclient
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

## Testing Flow

1. **Setup MetaMask**

    - Open MetaMask
    - Add network:
        - Network Name: Hardhat Local
        - RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
        - Chain ID: 31337
        - Currency Symbol: ETH
    - Import accounts using private keys from hardhat node output
        - Import owner account
        - Import validator accounts (at least 2)

2. **Fund Allocation Process**

    - Connect wallet using owner account
    - Go to "Allocate Funds" panel
    - Fill in project details:
        - Project Name
        - Description
        - Amount in ETH
    - Click "Allocate Funds"
    - Confirm transaction in MetaMask

3. **Validation Process**

    - Switch to validator account in MetaMask
    - Go to "Validator Panel"
    - Enter Project ID (starts from 0)
    - Click "Validate Project"
    - Confirm transaction in MetaMask
    - Repeat with different validator account
    - Project is completed after required validations (default: 2)

4. **View Project Status**

    - "Pending Projects" panel shows unvalidated projects
    - Progress bar indicates validation status
    - Projects disappear when fully validated

5. **Optional: Adjust Validator Weights**
    - Connect with owner account
    - Use "Validator Weights" panel
    - Select validator
    - Set new weight (1-100)
    - Higher weights give validators more influence

## Smart Contract Features

-   **Fund Allocation**: Track fund allocations with project details
-   **Multi-validator System**: Require multiple validations for project completion
-   **Weighted Validation**: Validators can have different influence levels
-   **Time-bound Validation**: Optional validation window
-   **Transparent History**: All transactions and validations are on-chain

## Common Issues & Solutions

1. **MetaMask Connection Issues**

    - Ensure correct network (Hardhat Local)
    - Reset account if nonce issues occur

2. **Transaction Failures**

    - Check account has enough ETH
    - Ensure correct account role (owner/validator)

3. **Contract Interaction Issues**
    - Verify contract address in config
    - Check ABI matches deployed contract

## Development Notes

-   Contract address needs to be updated in `webclient/src/config/wagmi.ts`
-   Default validation requirement is 2 validators
-   Owner can adjust validation parameters
-   All amounts are in Wei (1 ETH = 10^18 Wei)

# Enhanced Funding Features

The project now includes an enhanced smart contract (`EnhancedFunding.sol`) that implements the following features:

## Key Components

1. **Donation Contract**: Allows users to create fundraisers and donate funds.

    - Create fundraisers with target amounts and deadlines
    - Accept donations from multiple contributors
    - Track donation history per fundraiser

2. **Fund Allocation Contract**: Holds funds in escrow until community approval.

    - Transparent allocation and tracking of funds
    - Conversion of fundraisers to projects once funded
    - Weighted validation system

3. **DAO Governance Contract**: Implements a voting mechanism for fund release.

    - Proposal creation for milestone validation
    - Weighted voting system based on validator power
    - Automatic execution of approved proposals

4. **Multi-Signature Wallet Contract**: Ensures withdrawals require multiple approvals.

    - Customizable number of required approvals per project
    - Project-specific approvers list
    - Secure withdrawal process

5. **Proof-of-Impact (PoI) Fund Release**: A milestone-based system that releases funds in steps based on governance votes.
    - Create projects with multiple milestones
    - Milestone-based fund allocation
    - Sequential release of funds as milestones are completed

## Using the Enhanced Contract

### Deployment

```bash
# Compile the contracts
npm run compile

# Deploy to local network
npm run deploy:enhanced

# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npm run deploy:enhanced:sepolia

# Build and copy ABI to frontend
npm run build:enhanced
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests on local network
npm run test:enhanced
```

### Contract Workflow

1. **Fundraising Phase**

    - Creator starts a fundraiser with target amount
    - Donors contribute to the fundraiser
    - Once target is reached, fundraiser converts to a project

2. **Validation Phase**

    - Validators review and validate the project
    - Once enough weighted validations are received, project is marked complete

3. **Governance Phase**

    - Proposals are created for milestone validation
    - Validators vote on proposals
    - If approved, milestone is validated

4. **Multi-sig Release Phase**

    - Withdrawal requests are created for validated milestones
    - Approvers review and approve withdrawal requests
    - Once enough approvals are received, funds are released to recipient

5. **Milestone Progression**
    - Project moves to next milestone after current one is completed
    - Process repeats until all milestones are completed
